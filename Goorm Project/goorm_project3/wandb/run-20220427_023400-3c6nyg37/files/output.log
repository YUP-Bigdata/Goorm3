/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/transformers/models/encoder_decoder/modeling_encoder_decoder.py:530: FutureWarning: Version v4.12.0 introduces a better way to train encoder-decoder models by computing the loss inside the encoder-decoder framework rather than in the decoder itself. You may observe training discrepancies if fine-tuning a model trained with versions anterior to 4.12.0. The decoder_input_ids are now created based on the labels, no need to pass them yourself anymore.
